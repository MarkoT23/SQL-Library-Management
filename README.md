#### A short side project delving into SQL database design I created. Topics include but are not limited to Database design and modeling, DDL, query optimization, and analysis.
This was a simple side project that aimed to nurture my SQL skills and sample data provided in a table. This is my first SQL project and I've never taken a SQL class so I aim to further hone my skills with more projects like this one.
